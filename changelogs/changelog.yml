  1.1.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - entry - Changed some keys of the return object from the Ansible module. Please
        check README.md
      - entry - The module entry requires the parameter group_path if entry is not
        located under the root directory. That way the module can make sure which
        entry should be touched, even if duplicate entries in different directories
        exist
      - group - Changed some keys of the return object from the Ansible module. Please
        check README.md
      - group - The module group requires the parameter path if group is not located
        under the root directory. When creating a new group the parameter create_path
        must be set.
      major_changes:
      - group - nested group creation is possible, if create_path was set to true
      minor_changes:
      - entry - range for icon_id was specified
      - entry - updated documetation
